When doing the phish, add invisible image links to your C2 domain so that multiple users will have loaded the C2 domain before use. By the time the domain is used, it won't be a low number of users who have accessed the domain, it can be like 20. Then when the C2 goes in, it's no longer new and low user count. And just to be safe, I'd load unused domains too, like ones that don't belong to you. So that the SOC can go on a wild goose chase even if they think they know what you're doing. Even better, load a JS snippet that just keeps reloading resources from the websites so that there's more hit count per user :D"
